In my daily life, I am using operations and machine learning methodologies
to solve different real-life problems from forecasting, optimization, 
simulation to natural language processing. Since the requirements of each
of these problems are different, I (like to) research, read, and learn 
a lot of new things everyday. I decided to put them together in this 
blog with the hope of helping others!
