We have discussed [Beta Distribution](https://elifilkegokce.github.io/beta-distribution/)
in our previous post. If customers called the contact center for only two
reasons, then Beta distribution would be enough to formulate the
probability of a call to be associated with a certain reason. 
However, a call can be related to multiple reasons. For example, a call may be
associated with a check order, account information update, and
bill payment at the same time. In that case, we need a generalized
model, which considers all possible call reasons.
