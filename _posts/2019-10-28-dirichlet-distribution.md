To exclude files when using **Algolia** as a search provider add an array to `algolia.files_to_exclude` in your `_config.yml`. For more configuration options be sure to check their [full documentation](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/options.html).

```yaml
algolia:
  # Exclude more files from indexing
  files_to_exclude:
    - index.html
    - index.md
    - excluded-file.html
    - 2019-10-27-hello.md
    - subdirectory/*.html
```
